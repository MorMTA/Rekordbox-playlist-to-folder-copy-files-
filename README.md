# Rekordbox-playlist-to-folder-copy-files-
Helps to move out of Rekordbox with python by copying songs from made playlists in Rekordbox to new folders.

#Motivation
This project was made by me after trying to move out of Rekordbox and had
to move each one of my songs, one by one to a new playlist.
wasn't going to do that hard work so i made this program, it recives the name each song
looks it up in a path (for example: /Contents, a folder made by Rekordbox) and then copy it
to a chosen destination folder.


#Instructions:
1. In Rekordbox, right click the chosen playlist and export to KUVO text file
2. open the text file with EXCEL, it will prompt some messages, keep it on deafults
3. copy the TRACK TITLE row to a new excel file
4. save it as text file with delimiters
5. replace the txt_file_name with your text file path\name
6. Enjoy!
